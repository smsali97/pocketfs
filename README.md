#  PocketFS

*PocketFS* is named after the pocket gopher, the mascot for the Go Programming Language and because of its lightweight and simplistic nature 

*PocketFS* is going to be a distributed file system which supports multiple nodes which can be added and removed dynamically and a client interface written in React that will interact with it.
